    "### Résumé de ce que j'ai compris de l'article\n",
    "\n",
    "La Méthode ROME fonctionne en gros sur un système key-value qu'on retrouve dans les poids du modèle. On assaie donc d'insérer un couple (k*,v*) à un endroit précis dans notre réseau de neurone.\n",
    "En pratique:\n",
    "1. On séléctionne la clé k en faisant une moyenne sur des textes tirés de Wikipédia, j'avoue que je saisis pas trop comment encore.\n",
    "2. On résoud un problème d'optimisation afin de trouver v associé, voir l'équation sur l'article\n",
    "3. On insère v* ainsi obtenu.\n",
    "-> L'insertion se fait visiblement à la couche 18, puisque c'est là qu'on remarque un changement du comportement des couches de MLP qui switchent et commence à agir comme des valeurs (v) et non plus comme des clés (k)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ils commencent par calculer les moments d'ordre 2 (voir les maths dans l'article) en utilisant 10000 échantillons de couches cachées (k), que l'on compute en utilisant des tokesnde toutes les pages Wikipedia (2020-05-01 snapshot)-> On ne se limite pas aux sujets mais tous les tokens sont aussi inclus visiblement.\n",
    "-> Le text complet de chaque article est passé dans le transformer jusq'à ce qu'on atteigne la limite, puis on stocke les activations de la partie MLP (k) pour chaque token de l'article en question.\n",
    "-> Et on repète le process jusqu'à obtenir 10 000 vecteur k. Ensuite on calcule les moments d'ordre 2 E[kk^T]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bon c'est pas hyper clair mdr\n",
